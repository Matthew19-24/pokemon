Pokémon Battle Mechanics

This is a project I started for fun.

Originally, I just wanted to duplicate how Pokémon stats were generated.
As I started diving into it, I noticed the complexity behind it, this had sparked my interest even more.
Now that I have replicated how the stats are generated, I have tried to replicate the battle mechanics.
I am now messing around with adding GUI.

So far:

-The story begins text-based-adventure style.

-The user can name themself and their rival

-The user can pick one out of three of the starter Pokémon

-The rival with chose the opposing Pokémon with type advantage to the users choice

-The stats will be randomly generated and visable for user to see

-Experience points are gained and leveling up is achieved correctly



What I plan on working on:

-Making a visual battle system with GUI

-Leveling up to specific level will result in evolution of Pokémon

-Continuation of story

-Pokémon catching

-Save/Load feature


If you want to run the file, you would run the Game.py file.
