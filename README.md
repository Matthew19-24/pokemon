Pok√©mon Battle Mechanics

This is just a project that I started for fun.

Originally I just wanted to duplicate how a Pokemon's stats were generated. 
As I started getting into it, I noticed the complexity behind it, and decided to dive deeper into the project.
Trying to replicate things like chosing your starter Pokemon and actual battles.

If you want to run the file, you would run the Game.py file.
